            <p>Traders are well-aware of cryptocurrency’s fast-paced market movements. In fact, traders often consider
              digital currency’s <strong>volatility</strong> as more of a feature than a bug, <a href="">using it to their advantage. </a>
            </p>
            <p>Still, volatility complicates things when trying to invest in crypto long-term or use it as an
              alternative store of value.</p>
            <p>For these purposes, stablecoins rose to prominence. They’re incredibly useful for multiple purposes,
              including as a<strong> medium of exchange.</strong> They also come with many of the benefits that
              decentralized crypto possesses. USDC and USDT are the most popular stablecoins, but how do they compare?
              Learn about the differences between the two, and which one you should choose.</p>
            <h2><strong>USDC vs. USDT: What are stablecoins?</strong></h2>
            <p>Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is directly tied, or <a href=""><strong>pegged</strong></a>, to the price of
              another asset. Most stablecoins are pegged to a fiat currency - both USDC and USDT are pegged to the US
              dollar. This means that one of these coins is worth $1.00 almost exactly. True to their name, stablecoins
              provide much-needed stability to an overall volatile crypto market. </p>
            <h3><strong>Crypto and the volatility problem</strong></h3>
            <p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can experience price fluctuations of over 10% in just a few hours - or
              sometimes minutes. Imagine agreeing to sell an asset for one Bitcoin - but it loses 5% of its value
              immediately afterward. Hence, traders can use stablecoins for more common transactions, as their value
              rarely fluctuates. Due to this, they also make great exchange alternatives, with steady exchange rates. 
            </p>
            <p>However, stablecoins still have many of the attractive crypto features they are looking for. While most
              are centralized, some stablecoins are managed on decentralized blockchains. They are exchanged just as
              quickly and securely as Bitcoin, without intermediaries. They’re also stored in virtual wallets, are
              exchanged for many types of assets, and keep the user’s privacy intact.</p>
            <h3><strong>USDC vs. USDT: A history lesson</strong></h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.centre.io/">Centre Consortium</a>, founded by crypto giants Circle and Coinbase,
              launched the USDC stablecoin in 2018. Circle Internet Financial, a US-based financial service company,
              manages USDC. However, the Centre acts as the official USDC regulator. Having a third party control the
              stablecoin is crucial to keeping transparency open for users. </p>
            <p>USDT or USD Tether launched in late 2014 and runs on OmniLayer, a platform created on top of the Bitcoin
              blockchain. At the time of its launch, its name was Realcoin - however, it soon changed to USDT. It was
              the first stablecoin to successfully peg to the US dollar at a 1:1 ratio. <a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a> regulates the stablecoin and is in control of minting new USDT and
              circulating it.</p>
            <h2><strong>USDC vs. USDT: Understanding the differences</strong></h2>
            <p>USDC and USDT have several characteristics in common, as they’re both fiat-collateralized stablecoins
              pegged to the US dollar. They are both useful for routine payments and operate on multiple blockchains,
              making them more accessible. Both stablecoins transfer seamlessly and rapidly from peer to peer. However,
              the two stablecoins have some key differences which make the choice between them clearer. </p>
            <ol role="list">
              <li><strong>Market Cap: </strong>The market cap of an asset describes the total market value (or number of
                coins) that are minted and in circulation. It is affected by supply and demand and is a big indicator of
                that asset’s growth potential. At the time of writing, the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/usd-coin/">USDC market cap</a> $27 is billion, while the <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/">USDT’s market cap</a> is $83.7 billion. The market
                cap between the two has always been significant. USDT has a much larger liquid trading volume available.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="2" role="list">
              <li><strong>Backing: </strong>Both of these stablecoins are backed by other assets, which is how their
                value remains consistent. USDC is backed by cash and cash equivalents, while <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/13/tethers-first-reserve-breakdown-shows-token-49-backed-by-unspecified-commercial-paper/">USDT
                  is backed by a mix of cash, treasuries, and liquid debt.</a> These assets are reserves, which improve
                the liquidity of the stablecoins. <strong><br /><br /></strong></li>
              <li><strong>Regulation: </strong>USDC is fully regulated, and not just by Centre. It follows the US
                regulations for anti-money laundering and know-your-customer purposes. It’s consistently under US
                regulatory scrutiny. USDT’s compliance with regulations is less clear. </li>
            </ol>
            <h2><strong>USDT Advantages</strong></h2>
            <ul role="list">
              <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> USDT is the older and more established of the two stablecoins, so it has
                the upper hand in historical usage. It is more widely used due to its longer circulation as well.
                <br /><strong><br /></strong>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Trading volume and availability: </strong>Of the two, USDT has a much larger trading and
                liquidity volume available and is traded on multiple markets. It is supported on blockchain platforms
                like Ethereum, Solana, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash’s Standard Leger Protocol, and more. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul role="list">
              <li><strong>Liquidity</strong>: Due to its market cap, USDT also has a higher liquidity rate. High
                liquidity protects traders from huge swings in crypto prices. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul role="list">
              <li><strong>Market sentiments: </strong>Much of the cryptocurrency community has trust in Tether, having
                used it reliably for nearly a decade. You may encounter many traders who are more comfortable in
                receiving or giving you USDT in exchange for other assets. </li>
            </ul>
            <h2><strong>USDC Advantages</strong></h2>
            <h3><strong>Regulatory compliance and transparency</strong></h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.circle.com/en/legal/usdc-terms">USDC makes clear </a>that it complies with US
              regulations to protect customers and prevent financial crimes. USDT, on the other hand, has been involved
              in mild controversy. As recently as 2021, Tether and Bitfinex were involved in a legal battle with the New
              York Attorney General’s office. The Attorney General made allegations that the organization used funds for
              USDT reserves improperly. </p>
            <p><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tether-to-report-reserves-and-pay-18-5m-fine-after-settlement-with-nyag">The
                parties settled out of court</a> and Tether admitted no wrongdoing, but its regulatory compliance was
              put into question.USDC also makes monthly testaments to its composition of reserves, while USDT makes
              quarterly reports. USDC’s monthly attestations are also checked by Grant Thornton LLP, the largest
              auditing firm in the US.</p>
            <h3><strong>Less complicated reserves</strong></h3>
            <p>USDC’s reserves are made entirely of cash and cash equivalents, while USDT’s reserves are mixed with a
              wider range of assets. Depending on your perspective, USDT’s reserves may cause more risk or have better
              diversification. </p>
            <h3><strong>Redemptions</strong></h3>
            <p>While both stablecoins offer redemptions for USD, USDC’s process is a bit simpler. USDT has a $100,000
              cap and charges a $150 USDT verification fee. Users also have to redeem their USDT through a crypto
              exchange platform. USDC offers direct redemptions through Circle and has a $100 minimum exchange
              requirement. USDC redemptions are also conducted through simple bank wires.</p>
            <h2><strong>Is USDC better than USDT?</strong></h2>
            <p>So, do the advantages above make USDC a better option? The answer: <strong>it depends on what your goal
                is. </strong>USDC is largely considered<br /></p>
            <ul role="list">
              <li>more secure, </li>
              <li>well-regulated,</li>
              <li>and perhaps more liquid due to its cash reserves. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, USDT has a larger trading volume, and its reserves may make it better for diversification
              purposes. </p>
            <p>If you need a more accessible and widely-used stablecoin, then USD Tether is the better choice. On the
              other hand, you may want to invest in a more secure stablecoin with an easier redemption process. In this
              case, USDC by Circle Consortium is preferable.</p>
            <h2><strong>What happens if USD collapses?</strong></h2>
            <p>Since both stablecoins are pegged to the US dollar, it’s logical to assume their values will fall if USD
              collapses. Cash also backs both USDC and USDT, meaning its reserves and liquidity will also fall. You
              probably don’t need to worry about this scenario happening. </p>
            <p>While both stablecoins have de-pegged from the US dollar (falling just under $1.00),<strong> it’s
                extremely unlikely that an entire fiat currency totally loses value.</strong> </p>
            <p>What would happen to stablecoins if crypto surpassed USD instead? Some crypto experts predict this might
              happen due to crypto’s international status, including <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/07/16/transcend-the-us-dollar-blackrock-ceo-issues-important-crypto-prediction-after-huge-week-for-the-bitcoin-ethereum-and-xrp-price/?sh=445bdeff1b11">BlackRock
                chief Larry Fink.</a> Crypto resides in a gray regulatory area for the US and other powerful countries,
              including South Korea, Australia, Germany, Japan, and more.</p>
            <p>If crypto were to transcend their fiat currencies, they will need to establish new regulatory frameworks
              - like <a href="https://www.youhodler.com/blog/crypto-valley-conference-2023">MiCA</a> for example)
              Stablecoins may become even more popular, though their value remains unchanged. </p>
            <h2><strong>USDC vs. USDT: Bottom line</strong></h2>
            <p>As explained in this article, both USDC and USDT have advantages. Ultimately, choosing one over the other
              comes down to your personal beliefs, physical location, and involvement in the cryptocurrency market. As
              with any cryptocurrency, you should do your research and keep up with the latest news surrounding USDC or
              USDT to ensure both options are still strong and stable.</p>
            <p>Currently, YouHodler has both USDT and USDC on its platform for you to try and see what works best for
              your investment strategy. </p>
