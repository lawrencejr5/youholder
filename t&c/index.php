            <h3>  Regulation and Risk</h3>

            <p> Your Yield Finance Account is not a bank account, deposit account, savings account or any other type of asset account and should not be treated or characterised as a banking product or service. Yield is not providing an investment-based or loan-based crowdfunding platform.
            </p>
            <p>When you transfer Digital Assets to Yield they will be held in your Wallet in accordance with these Terms, unless and until you designate such assets for lending by clicking “Earn”, “Lock” or “Stake” on the Yield Finance Platform. Any Digital Assets designated by you to receive interest constitute a loan from you to Yield in accordance with these Terms. By lending your Digital Assets to Yield Finance you grant Yield Finance all rights and title to such Digital Assets, to the fullest extent permitted by law, for Yield Finance to use in its own discretion.
            </p>
            <p>We will use these lent Digital Assets for our own commercial purposes, which may include us investing them with third party exchanges. In return, we will pay you interest in the same Digital Assets you lent to Yield Fincs (Yield Finance) and/or in YFS Token in accordance with the rewards tiers published on our website.
            </p>
            <p>All Digital Assets held in your Wallet prior to clicking “Earn”, "Lock" or “Stake” and being designated as lent Digital Assets are assets held by Yield Finance for your benefit on a custodial basis. Among other things, this means:
            </p>
            <p>Title to Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not be transferred until the designated Digital Assets are lent to Yield Finance the Yield Finance Platform. As the owner of Digital Assets in your Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. Yield Fincs shall not have any liability for fluctuations in the Fiat Currency value of Digital Assets held in your Yield Fincs Account.
            </p>
            <p>Other than when lent to Yield Fincs on the Yield Fincs Platform, none of the Digital Assets in your Wallet are the property of Yield Fincs; Yield Fincs does not represent or treat assets in a User’s Wallet as belonging to Yield Fincs. Yield Fincs may not grant a security interest in the Digital Assets held in your Wallet. Except as required by a facially valid court order, or except when lent in accordance with these Terms, Yield Fincs will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate, or otherwise alienate Digital Assets in your Wallet unless instructed by you or compelled by a court of competent jurisdiction to do so
            </p>
            <p>Prior to designating your Digital Assets as lent to Yield Fincs, you control the Digital Assets held in your Wallet. At any time, subject to these Terms, outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Digital Assets by sending it to a different wallet address of your choice as you may see fit in your own discretion
            </p>
            <p>In order to hold User’s Digital Assets more securely, Yield Fincs may use its blockchain addresses, Cold Storage wallets or other blockchain addresses or wallets as it sees fit to store User’s Digital Assets, separately to Yield’s Fincs Digital Assets. User’s Digital Assets which are held in the User’s Wallet and not lent are identifiably segregated from Yield’s Digital Assets or funds by way of separate ledger accounting entries for User’s and Yield’s Fincs accounts. Not withstanding the foregoing, Yield Fincs shall not have any obligation to use different blockchain addresses to store Digital Assets owned by you and Digital Assets owned by other Users or by Yield Fincs with respect to lent Digital Assets.
            </p>
            <p>Yield Fincs is under no obligation to issue any replacement Digital Assets in the event that any Digital Assets, password or a User’s private key is lost, stolen, malfunctioning, destroyed or otherwise inaccessible.
            </p>



            <p>As part of Yield Fincs Services, Yield has engaged various Third Party Service Providers which are regulated and authorised in respect of the services they provide. You acknowledge and agree that our providing access to services with Third Party Service Providers shall not be deemed to confer any requirement for authorisation on the part of Yield Fincs, or constitute Yield Fincs being regulated or authorised to provide the services that are provided by the Third Party Service Providers.
            </p>
            <p>You acknowledge and agree that any Service referred to in a Service Schedule shall be provided to you by the Operator and/or such Third Party Service Provider specified in that Service Schedule. In such case, the relevant Specified Service shall be provided to you on and subject to these Terms, with references in these Terms to "Yield Fincs" (or "we", "our" or "us") being read as references to the Operator or Third Party Service Provider specified in the relevant Service Schedule, unless the context provides otherwise, and under no circumstances shall any other person, including any affiliate of the Operator or Third Party Service Provider, be liable to you for the performance of any of the Operator or Third Party Service Provider's obligations under these Terms.
            </p>
            <h3>THE REGULATORY REGIME GOVERNING DIGITAL ASSETS</h3>

            <p>The regulatory framework governing Digital Assets remains unsettled and laws, regulations, or guidelines may be signiﬁcantly revised and amended which may materially and adversely affect the value of Digital Assets and our services on the Yield Fincs Platform
            </p>
            <p>Yield Fincs may be required to obtain licences, permits, and/or approvals in any jurisdiction where it seeks to offer it's Services. If Yield Fincs is unable to obtain such regulatory approvals or if such regulatory approvals are not renewed or are revoked for any reason, the Users in such jurisdictions may be unable to access or use the Yield Services or may be restricted to use part of the Yield Services. In the case where Yield Fincs may be requested or forced to suspend or discontinue or to change the operation of the Yield Fincs Services in any jurisdiction required by law or authorities, your Yield Fincs Account may be restricted for an indeﬁnite period of time until the matter is solved
            </p>
            <p>You shall be responsible for determining whether the use of the Our Services is legal in your jurisdiction, and you shall not access or use Our Services if, to the best of your knowledge they are illegal in your jurisdiction. If you are uncertain on the legal status of Digital Assets in your jurisdiction, please seek independent advice from your legal advisor.
            </p>
            <h4>Risk of Loss of Value</h4>

            <p>The value of Digital Assets are affected by several factors, including but not limited to, the total number of Digital Assets in existence, the continued willingness of market participants to exchange Fiat Currencies for Digital Assets, purchasers' expectations with respect to the rate of inﬂation of Fiat Currencies, purchasers' expectations with respect to the rate of deﬂation of cryptocurrencies, interest rates, currency exchange rates, cyber theft of cryptocurrencies, or news of such theft from digital wallets, investment and trading activities of large investors, monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations, regulatory measures, the global or regional political, economic or ﬁnancial events and situations. Thus, all these factors shall affect the value of Digital Assets, which may result in the permanent partial or total loss of the value of a particular Digital Asset. No one shall be obliged to guarantee the liquidity or the market price of any of the Digital Assets deposited by you into a Yield account. The volatility and unpredictability of the value of Digital Assets relative to Fiat Currencies may result in a signiﬁcant loss over a short period of time.
            </p>
            <h4>Lending Risk</h4>

            <p>You do not have any oversight or control over the Digital Assets that you have lent to Yield, and, subject to the next sentence, any gain or loss from our activities will be borne by Yield Fincs and not you. However, if any entity or third party that Yield Fincs lends to defaults on its obligations to Us then we may impose limits on your ability to use Yield or reduce the interest rates we are willing to pay. If our losses are large, we have reserved funds to ensure clients Needs are met. Although we cannot remove this risk of losses entirely, to reduce it we perform due diligence on all entities and third parties we deal with.
            </p>

            <h4>Taxation</h4>
            <p>The tax treatment of Digital Assets is uncertain, and it is your responsibility to determine whether taxes arise from your use of the Yield Fincs Services. You acknowledge and agree that Yield Fincs does not provide investment, legal or tax advice and that you shall be solely responsible for reporting and paying any applicable taxes arising from your use of the Yield Fincs Services
            </p>

            <h4>Miscellaneous </h4>

            <p><strong>10.1.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Yield Financial Services regarding your use of the Site.</p>
