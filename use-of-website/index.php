            <p>Yield regularly monitors and assesses activities that may constitute a potential breach of laws relating to AML, CFT, sanctions and anti-bribery, and other relevant Applicable Laws and/or international regulations.

            <h3>
                Unsuccessful identification of a person and verification of person’s identity data
            </h3>
            <p>In certain instances, whether to establish a business relationship between a User and Yield, to open a Yield Account and/or conclude a transaction on the Yield Platform, Users may be subject to Additional KYC in accordance with provisions of the Applicable Laws and the conditions set out in applicable laws and regulations. In addition, the User agrees that the identity verification, Additional KYC and the Yield Services shall be governed by ASIC. </p>

            <strong>User’s identity verification and Additional KYC will be unsuccessful in the following circumstances:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The User intentionally submits data that does not correspond with the identification data entered in the identity document provided or does not coincide with the information or data obtained with other procedures
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Additional KYC session expires or is interrupted, the identification questionnaire or the interview or the Additional KYC session expires when the User has not completed any activity within 15 minutes
                </li>
                <li>
                    The information flow that transmits synchronised sound and image is not satisfactory to the Yield Services’ requirements
                </li>
                <li>
                    The User does not submit the required confirmations to the identity verification or Additional KYC
                </li>
                <li>
                    The User fails to comply with the instructions recognising the User’s face or identity documents
                </li>
                <li>
                    The User uses the assistance of another person without Yield’s permission
                </li>
                <li>
                    There are suspicions regarding money laundering or terrorist financing.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, the identification of a person and verification of a person’s identity and residential location does not oblige Yield to establish a business relationship or guarantee access to Yield Services. If it is found that the User has intentionally submitted incorrect data which does not correspond to the identity documents provided or there are circumstances that give rise to suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing, Yield may send a notice to ASIC in accordance with the provisions of the ASIC Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Finance of Terrorism Act.
